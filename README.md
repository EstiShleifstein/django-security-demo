## Content of 25-minute Presentation I Gave For My Cybersecurity Course
- Developed a demonstrative hands-on website to showcase the security features Django provides, thereby mitigating many vulnerabilities, such as CSRF, XSS, SQL injections, and BAC attacks. 
- Secured the admin page by changing the default URL and installing a honeypot on the imposter admin page to deceive potential attackers and gain information on potential threat actors using the website.
- Integrated Catchpta for additional protection against bots discovering the real admin page.
